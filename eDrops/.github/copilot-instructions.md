- You must always answer in English.
- Comment all public methods with single-line description in English.
- Don't comment the code inside a method.
- Write SQL queries with UPPERCASE keywords and lowercase otherwise.
- Don't use var instead of val in Kotlin unless the variable needs to be changed.
- Maven dependencies must always be added in alphabetical order.
- Only fix formatting errors caused by your own code change.
- Don't fix existing formatting order, import order or formatting in other files
- Use Spring Data JPA and Hibernate, both simple CRUD and JPA annotations.
- Use Spring Security
- For XML parsing (marshall and unmarshall) always use Spring Boot's Jackson
- Write SQL adapted for MariaDB
- The code should be adapted for Spring Boot.
- Always use the latest Spring Boot standard. Currently it's version 4.
- Don't create simple unit tests that only test the language or included libraries
- The code should be adapted to the latest Kotlin version
- Limit the use of Javax to where it must be used, use Jakarta if you can.
- Use Thymeleaf to create web GUI, not Javascript.
- Create as little logic as possible in Thymeleaf, use Kotlin instead.
- If you must use Javascript, keep it simple and don't pull in Javascript libraries
- Use css if you must. It's just one large file. Keep it simple.
- Max line length is 120 characters for Java and Kotlin
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Java and Kotlin (2 spaces for YAML, JSON, HTML)
- Function calls with 4+ parameters should be split over multiple lines (not necessarily one parameter per line)
- Function calls with 1-3 parameters can be kept on one line if it fits
- In Kotlin: Use named parameters for function calls over multiple lines
- In Kotlin: Named parameters don't work for calls to Java methods - still split over multiple lines for 4+ parameters
- Don't clean up the code in other places than what I ask for.
- Don't change formatting and add new lines other than where you insert new code.
- 1 empty line between sections is good for readability, 2+ empty lines are usually unnecessary.
- Don't optimize or "improve" existing code unless explicitly requested
