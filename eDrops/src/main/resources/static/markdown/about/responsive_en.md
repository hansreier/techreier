## How this website adapts to your device

Responsive design is an approach to web design and development aimed at creating websites 
and applications that provide an optimal user experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
What is most important to me is that the same code base can easily adapt to different devices
without much effort. Inheritance from top HTML level with CSS and down to every GUI element is the key of this. 
Everything can be adapted with simple changes at CSS top level. I have simplified GUI by using one column
design regardless of screen size. This applies to text and input fields with labels.
Note: I have some tables with several columns, where some columns occasionally can be hidden on smaller devices.  

The functionality in my web app is developed to be able to select font sizes based on viewport sizes.
The background color on this page changes to white for small size, grey for medium size.
The font size decreases accordingly to the background color (small and medium is set to the same). 
Basic information about your device included dimensions and changing viewport sizes is shown here.  

Resize the window to test.  

The settings change over time. I want to adapt the website to different devices.
I prefer not to do this aggressively, because it can be confusing 
with too many changes in font size when resizing the viewport.
