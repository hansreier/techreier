### About this website

This is Reier's personal website, technology related.
I am a senior software engineer located in Moelv, Norway.

One part of this website discusses technology usage in general.
The other part is related to software development.
You cannot speak about any technology without asking some questions:

* Purpose of technology
* Benefit of technology
* Cost of technology
* Energy consumption
* Resource usage
* Impach on society
* Impact on nature
* Impact on climate

We humans have to build something to be happy, but recycling is boring.
"Houston we have a problem" they said, but how to fix the entire earth when we have messed it up.
Yes, technology used correctly can solve problems, but it can also make stuff worse.

The global warming and nature loss problems must be solved together, because they are closely related.
We solved the destruction of the ozon layer created by technology with technology, 
but can we solve this only by using technology? I think not.
I do not have the answer. You can not focus on climate change alone. This is the main mistake done
by politicans, techocrats and technologists. A new green industry is created to solve global warming,
but not without enormous resource usage and nature destruction. Refer to articles on this website
discussing this. 

### Goals of this website

* To publish my views on topics that engage me
  * Information and communication technology related
  * Energy, environment and climate related
  * Norwegian and global politics
* To publish technology related articles
  * Programming techniques
  * Backend: Kotlin / Spring Boot / Hibernate / MariaDB
  * Frontend: Thymeleaf / producing HTML from text
  * Devops: Running docker containers on Hostinger VPS
* Programming prototypes included in site

### Technology prototype

This website is really a technology prototype. If you find som strange text or menu items pointing
to nowhere, it just is not completed yet. Functionality will be added when I feel like it.
If you are interested in how the site was made, I have another entry explaining it (only in English)
