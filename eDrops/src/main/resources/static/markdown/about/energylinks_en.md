## My energy links and references

The list focuses mostly on energy issues related to electric power in Norway, and will be expanded.

NVE publishes a lot of statistics about electricity production
and consumption in Norway. Regrettably, very little is written in English, so I have not linked to it.
Below is a short summary of NVEs forecast for electric power production and consumption 
from the 2021 long term power marked analysis report (numbers in paranthesis) 
and the newer 2023 rapport. All numbers are in TWh.

|             | 2023 (2021) | 2030       | 2035    | 2040      |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Production  | 156 (158)   | 164 (166)  | 180     | 203 (186) |
| Consumption | 139 (138)   | 163 (159)  | 176     | 191 (174) |
| Balance     | 17  (20)    | 1   (7)    | 4       | 12  (12)  |

Increased power production mainly is caused by an increase in non-regulable fossil-free power (wind and sun) production, but also hydropower. 
Increased consumption mainly is caused by so-called green debatable renewable projects, 
data centers, transport, and other power-intensive industries. 
Nuclear power is not considered at all for 2040 in Norway, a mistake in my view.
I fear that revised forecasts will force more environmental destruction in Norway.
