## Energy and Norwegian Society

Norway is an energy producing country.
- Fossil energy production
  - Oil
  - Gas
  - Coal (not much)
- Renewabble energy production
  - Water power
  - Wind power
  - Solar power
  - Forest / biomass power
  - Wave power / tidal power
  - Thermal power
  - Heat recovery
  - Nuclear power

It can be discussed what is renewable energy production and what that is not.  

The entire world, since the Industrial Revolution, has become heavily dependent on large amounts of energy.
But how can we obtain this energy without consuming non-renewable resources and emitting waste products
(CO2, NOx, etc.)? High energy consumption has suddenly become a significant problem.
The solution is not simply more energy production and more energy consumption. 
This is the major mistake being made globally as a consequence of the green transition.
We need to consume less energy, not more, regardless of whether it is renewable energy production or not.  

In most countries, there is a desperate attempt to replace fossil energy production with renewable energy.
Unfortunately, large-scale solar farms and wind turbine industrial facilities have become synonymous with renewable energy production.
The production of these facilities requires an enormous consumption of resources, 
including inadequate recycling processes, and results in massive destruction of nature. 

One thing I advertise for is super-local grounding. 
This means producing energy primarily with solar panels on one's own property, or possibly with wind.
The latter is practically more difficult to implement and has only been attempted at DNT cabins in the mountain wilderness of Norway.
It should be noted that the wind turbine there is much, 
much smaller than the giant beasts that are popping up everywhere in wind turbine industrial facilities.
And by all means, call them wind turbine industrial facilities and not wind farms or parks, which sounds gentler. 
As soon as you connect to the national power grid, the problems, bureaucracy, and taxation arise.  

If we look at such local production in developing countries, it's worth noting that the climate is entirely different, 
and the bureaucracy and corruption are much worse. 
Therefore, having local electricity production for a village without connecting to a grid provider
would be a significant advantage and a great simplification. 
Old car batteries are used for energy storage. 
Regarding  Norway, I hope for a simplification of the entire process, 
making it easier to install solar panels on buildings and sell excess electricity to the grid owner. 
However, even this may require investments in the local power grid, which can drive up grid fees.

So, I am not against all electricity production with solar or wind power. 
But it must be limited, especially those large facilities in untouched nature.  

We have a power industry and a renewable energy sector that, consciously or unconsciously,
will push energy prices up to make as much money as possible. 
As long as this fits into the green transition and politicians believe in it, this will continue.

From a Norwegian perspective, cheap and stable electrical power supply is a prerequisite for the entire Norwegian society,
both historically and in the future. And what's happening now? 
Massive construction of industrial facilities for so-called renewable energy, which isn't even dispatchable energy.
The result is that only 1/3 of the potential of this energy production can be utilized.
It also requires significant grid investments to integrate this energy production with our existing cheap hydroelectric power.

Then energy prices will rise sharply. Even worse is that through the dysfunctional quasi-market for electricity Nordpool
and new high-capacity export cables, we have become dependent on European power prices, which have been significantly
increased in the preceding years. Since Germany has already made the same mistake as we are about to make: 
Massive expansion of wind and solar power. So it's bound to go wrong. For Germany, the closure of nuclear power is part of the equation. 
This electricity market and the financial electricity market on top of this have paved the way for electricity speculators. 
Electricity has become an increasingly suitable speculation object, as prices vary more and more.
I am referring to an episode in the NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) TV-series Exit.
Unfortunately, more realistic than I like.  

The result is high inflation, both direct and indirect, due to high energy prices.
There is significant potential for power shortages and power outages.
Energy-intensive industries cannot rely solely on unstable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. 
This was recently highlighted on NRK due to the start of construction of Google's data center near Porsgrunn,
which could potentially consume 5 percent of Norway's entire electricity consumption. That's enormous.
And this is not something to celebrate, even for me in the tech industry. 
In the same electricity area, we have foreign cables where electricity practically leaks out like a sieve. 
At the same time, existing industries in the Grenland area need even more power, 
also due to the electrification of process industries. 
And in this NRK program, most participants believed that this will work.  

*It will be sorted out, it always does*  
*Yes, it will resolve itself, that's how it usually goes*  
*it will fix itself in the end*  

(Timbuktu, Swedish poet / rapper)  

No, it doesn't. This just won't work. It's a predicted  catastrophe.
And the only way it can be resolved in this area is with nuclear power plants.
But Norwegian leading politicians don't want that. They bury their heads in the sand like ostriches.

Therefore, I focus on this topic, and not a bunch of other less important political issues. 
Unfortunately, the subject has been drowned by other matters in many previous parliamentary elections in Norway. 
It cannot continue like this, with the electricity (price) crisis still unresolved and the leading political parties
fully focused on the climate crisis.  


I'm trying to make people aware of this, so that they can choose for themselves whether it's worth supporting parties that,
in practice, have ruined the electricity market over the past 10 years and ensured expensive electricity in extremely cold Norway.

The reality is that we need energy production from many different sources to meet future energy needs in Norway, 
but giant industrial facilities for unregulated renewable energy such as wind and solar should be avoided. 
The Norwegian energy Commission's mantra (An initialive by the socialist gournment); more of everything, faster,
is completely wrong. 
This means uncritical development of everything at once, 
while various energy-saving measures are under-communicated. 
The vision involves no prioritization of what is smart or not, 
and does not emphasize the significant harm that destroyed nature will cause. 
The nature crisis is practically as serious as the climate crisis. 
If I were to manage an IT project according to this vision, it would definitely go completely wrong.
