### About this website

This is Reier's personal website, technology and society related.
I am a senior software engineer located in Moelv, Norway.

One part of this website discusses technology usage in society in general.
The other part is related to software development.
You cannot speak about any technology without asking some questions:

* Purpose of technology
* Benefit of technology
* Cost of technology
* Energy consumption
* Resource usage
* Impact on society
* Impact on nature
* Impact on climate

We humans have to build something to be happy, but recycling is boring.
"Houston we have a problem" they said, but how to fix the entire earth when we have messed it up.
Yes, technology used correctly can solve problems, but it can also make stuff worse.

The global warming and nature loss problems must be solved together, because they are closely related.
We solved the destruction of the ozon layer created by technology with technology, 
but can we solve this even more complex problem by just using technology? I think not.
I do not have the answer. You can not focus on climate change alone. This is the main mistake done
by politicans, techocrats and technologists. A new green industry is created to solve global warming,
but not without enormous resource usage and nature destruction. Refer to articles on this website
discussing this. 

### Goals of this website

* To publish my views on topics that engage me:
  * Information and communication technology related
  * Energy, environment and climate related
  * Norwegian and global politics
* To publish technology related articles:
  * Programming techniques
  * Backend: Kotlin / Spring Boot / Hibernate / MariaDB
  * Frontend: Thymeleaf / producing HTML from text
  * Devops: Running docker containers on Hostinger VPS (Virtual Private Linux Server)
* Programming prototypes is included here

### Technology prototype

This website is really a technology prototype. If you find som strange text or menu items pointing
to nowhere, it just is not completed yet. Functionality will be added when I feel like it.
If you are interested in how the site was made, I have another entry explaining it (only in English)

### How to make a text based website without coding HTML

The goal is to do this as simple as possible. One option is to use mardown like in readme.md file,
since this is simpler that RTF and uses less disk space. Perhaps the system in the future will support both formats.
External text editors like Intellij can be used, or a text editor to be included in this project (TODO).
I have used server side HTML rendering (Thymeleaf). The reason for this it that for simple text oriented web pages,
it is quicker to develop an easier to maintain, compared to using client based web technologies like React or Angular.
This is at least valid for me, being basically a backend developer. Do not mix technologies, if you do not need to.
One thing to note is that server side rendering with Thymeleaf results in very clean HTML 5 with almost no Javascript added.

The first attempt is to use markdown written in Intellij or other editor, store it as a file included in the code,
and pick it up as a part of the Web user interface. No database is really required. 
I use a relational database to structure the blogs and metadata, and to enable viewing and writing 
the blog in different languages.

### No rocket science

To make a website like this is not like rocket science, and is really not very difficult to make.
In publishing this is called a content management system (CMS).  

But way make my own web publishing system?   

Because it is fun and I am in total control of the project.  

The vision is to make this simple, so I can publich stuff quickly to internet.
