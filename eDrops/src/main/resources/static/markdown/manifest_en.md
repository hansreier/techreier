## POWER MANIFEST FOR NORWAY:

The reason for writing this (originally in Norwegian) is because EU / EEA / ACER agreements gradually result in Norwey 
loosing control of its own electrical power production and consumption including electrical power prices. 
Most ordinary people in Norway disagrees with the official Norwegian and EU policy regarding this.  

**SO SORRY EU, Norwegian renewable energy is not up for grabs**  

It is not more avaiable than 1% of what you need anyway...

Key points:  

* Electricity is infrastructure on par with water and sewage and should not be a speculative object.
* It should be Norwegian ownership and control over the development, production, and sale of electric power.
* We need predictable, reasonably normal electricity prices for everyone:   
    - Ensures Norwegian businesses in general and energy-intensive industries in particular.
    - Ensures Norwegian households.  
    - Prevents price discrimination, geographic discrimination, and competitive distortion.
    - Ensures that sensible energy efficiency measures are implemented.
    - The end-customer market must be better regulated to prevent unfair contracts.
    - More power available does not necessarily mean lower electricity prices.
    - A too high share of non-dispatchable power will gradually increase electricity prices.
    - Expensive measures with questionable climate effects, such as electrification of the Norwegian continental shelf, should be dropped.
* Norway as an industrial nation is and will continue to be built on cheap hydropower.
* Norway should in the future be an industrial nation, not a raw material producer.
* The current electricity market via Nordpool is dysfunctional for domestic power sales.
* A common electricity market for Europe does not work as well as desired.
* The idea of Norway as Europe's battery is completely unrealistic and should be abandoned.
* The EEA/Energy Union, power agreements, and energy market packages are costly for industry and households.
* Export via the new export electricity cables (Germany and Scotland) should be regulated so we do not risk an electricity resource crisis again.
* We need a little more fossil-free energy before 2040 (22% - 36% , Source NVE [energy links](about/energylinks_en.md) )
* The Norwegian government Energy Commission's slogan, more of everything faster, is the wrong climate medicine
* Large-scale new energy production and consumption must be thoroughly evaluated locally based on established criteria:
    - Cost
    - Benefit
    - Emmissions
    - Nature loss
    - The first-come, first-served principle is abandoned.
* Today's energy policy leads to increased conflict levels and more extremism.
* Increased energy demands should be solved with:
    - As much dispatchable power production as possible, not unregulated, which provides stable power supply.
    - Upgrading hydropower plants, along with flood protection.
    - Energy efficiency and energy saving in general, supported by Enova, for everyone. 
    - Solar energy production based on local initiatives near buildings and industrial facilities.
    - Nuclear power plants in Norway, starting with prototype/research facilities for SMR.
    - Other energy production (thermal, bioenergy, waste heat recovery, etc.).
* Taxes and fees in Norway be in favor of dispatchable power production, not unregulated.
* The climate crisis is here, but it is not solved by escalating a nature crisis:
    - Focus is on global CO2 emissions, best addressed where the potential for emission reduction is greatest.
    - The forest should of course be included in Norway's CO2 accounting.
    - Oil and gas activities should be scaled down. 
    - We will always need fossil energy production, also as a basis for products.
* Wind power (on land and at sea) is environmentally destructive, resource-wasting, and poorly recyclable.
* Solar energy plants placed in untouched nature are not much better than wind energy plants.
* Non-dispatchable power (solar, wind) should not exceed 20% of total electricity production.
* The use of pumped hydro storage as a regulator can be considered, but hydrogen and large-scale batteries are unrealistic.
* Nevertheless, we still require upgrades of local and national power grid in Norway to handle more non-dispatchable power.
