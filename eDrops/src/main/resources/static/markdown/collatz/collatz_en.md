## Collatz conjecture

1. Select a random positive integer.
2. If the number is an even number, divide the number by 2.
3. If the number is an odd number, multiply the number by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat the process until the number ends on 1.
5. If the end result is not one, you will receive a prize.  

This is an unsolved mathematical problem, 
because no one has ever proven this is true.
I have no ambitions to solve it, but you can if you like.
