## Onsite, home office, or both

Throughout a long career in the IT industry, I have worked both in-house and as a consultant. 
I have also witnessed the development since I started working in Telenor's IT department in Lillehammer in 1989.
I have seen and worked in many different office environments, and I can observe what is most effective. 
Remark that this note is my subjective experience of the alternatives.  

From 1989, we spent many years working in cell offices with glass walls and curtains. 
I believe it was rare for me to actually draw the curtains. 
One very good thing about this setup was that it was easy to take phone calls and collaborate 
online with other locations without disturbing those working right next to you. 
As a developer, I was not easily distracted, and I could avoid noise-canceling headphones.  

After the financial crisis, the cell offices were definitely over for me. 
The old good cell office did not return. 
Before that, I had occasionally worked in Oslo, also in very large open spaces. 
It's nice because you hear everything that’s going on—too much, actually. 
It’s a bit uninteresting to overhear private conversations between other developers or; 
even worse, project meetings from another team in the same premises. 
That's when noise-canceling headphones became a must for most people. 
Some quiet rooms and meeting rooms were available, but it was always too little of that.    

It's impossible to know if someone wearing headphones is truly busy with something or just using them to block out noise.
Maybe they're just listening to music while working. 
So here we sit close together, the more the merrier, but we didn’t communicate anyway.
I might as well have been sitting in a hideaway office, if that had been allowed by the employer.  

Then came Covid-19. Bang. Everyone worked at home, and that turned out to be fine. 
Teams meetings became a daily routine. 
We even introduced coffee Teams meetings to substitute the conversations we had by the coffee machine.
I believe it was then that a large majority of leaders realized that this could actually work.
It had to work! For me, who didn’t have screaming children or a difficult spouse at home, concentrating was no problem.
It was easier to have a technical conversation online while we coded or fixed a bug. 
There was no one nearby to be disturbed or disturb. 
It was just like it had been in the cell offices. Freedom with responsibility, 
It’s the results that matter.  

Finally, we could go back into society again, both privately and at work. 
But something had changed. 
Working from home was still common at times because leaders had seen that it was nothing to be afraid of, 
and the need for control didn’t have to be so rigid. 
Employers could also reduce office space because not everyone were present all the time. 
have no problems working 2-3 days from home and spending the rest in the office. 
Concentration tasks were often done at home, while project and team work that benefited from physical collaboration 
was done on the days when most people were in the office. 
For me, that was increasingly dependent on commuting, this was a significant advantage.
This was at least as good as the old cell office. 
I encourage employers to consider flexible smaller open project spaces. 
That way, we avoid project meetings with other teams in the same premises.
The noise level becomes generally lower, even if it’s open space. 
It’s much more pleasant, and conversations can often take place right in the premises without too much disturbance. 
Some quiet rooms and meeting rooms in addition are, of course, always an advantage.  

Will this be a happy ending? 
Oh no, now employers are pressing again to get us back into often poorly adapted office spaces.
I have unfortunately seen this tendency. 
The management's ego and need for control have once again become too obvious. 
And I long to return to the cell office where it all started, in walking distance from home...
Work within ICT sector should be distributed and located closer to where people live, 
and not concentrated to Oslo the capital of Norway, but this is another discussion.  

I want to mention one more thing: 
Many people either are stuck in traffic jams to get to work or like sardines in a can in public transport. 
We are even encouraged at times by public authorities to stay home. 
Not everyone can actually walk or bike to work. Year-round cycling can be life-threatening. 
A lot of time is spent on commuting. A hybrid workday takes away some of the pressure on traffic systems. 
Furthermore, energy consumption decreases, which is a significant advantage for the green transition. 
Even though many have electric cars, it’s still a major benefit to have less resource burden. 
And even electric cars emit CO2 throughout their entire lifecycle.  

*Cheers for progress!? You can draw your own conclusions based on your own experiences.*  

In some years, it will be over. Then I will be retired.
