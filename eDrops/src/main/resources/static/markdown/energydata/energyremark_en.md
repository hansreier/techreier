## Comments on the data

The energy from oil and gas in the North Sea is 16 times greater than our electricity production, most of which is exported.
If fossil energy is to be replaced by renewables, production must increase dramatically.
In practice, it is more than enough for us to replace our own fossil energy consumption with renewables.
If we act too quickly, it will hurt both the population and industry.
The result may be that industry relocates, we become poorer,
and global COâ‚‚ emissions increase because production shifts to countries with a higher fossil share.
Real cuts require cooperation across national borders.
