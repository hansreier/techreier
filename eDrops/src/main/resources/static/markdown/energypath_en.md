# Energy solutions that work – for people, nature and climate

This list focuses on Norwegian measures but emphasizes that global efforts are by far the most important.  
The Paris Agreement can easily lead to unfortunate suboptimization, but there seems to be no clear alternative.  
Global efforts must be adapted to each country. It's important to take action where the effect is greatest.  
Current strategies often focus on reducing CO₂ where the impact is minimal, rather than where the potential is greatest.

We should start with realistic, high-impact measures that can be implemented using today’s technology.  
Anyone who has worked on large IT projects knows this principle well.  
I'm not an energy expert, but this translates well from IT development projects.

### Norwegian measures

1. Deprioritize wind power on land and at sea to avoid large, costly and nature-unfriendly interventions.
2. Initiate the development of nuclear power to ensure long-term, stable energy supply.
3. Invest in local solar energy where it makes sense, without harming nature.
4. Prioritize rail transport as an environmentally friendly and efficient option.
5. Be cautious with expensive, land- and nature-intensive solutions – prioritize resource-saving alternatives.
6. Continue investment in hydropower and other established solutions for energy production and savings.
7. Prioritize local solutions with short distances between energy production and industry.
8. Reform energy regulations and start a dialogue with the EU, focusing on global goals and local implementation.
9. Reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and establish more practical energy regulations and frameworks.
10. Maintain Norwegian oil and gas production as a key part of the global energy supply for a long time to come.  

### Global measures

1. Nuclear power is essential globally to reduce CO2 emissions.
2. Implement measures where CO2 reductions will have the greatest impact.
3. Stop destruction and degradation of nature; climate actions that harm nature are counterproductive.
4. Prioritize local conditions in implementation.
5. War and conflicts must end, as they cause serious harm to the environment and shift focus away from climate.
6. International cooperation across borders is crucial.
7. Support global trade but reduce overall transport volumes.
8. Invest in solar power, especially with local anchoring.
9. Promote sustainable agriculture to preserve food production and nature.
10. Reduce total energy demand through smarter technology, addressing global production chains and population growth.

### Conclusion

The main problem is that global measures often fail to be implemented due to the chaotic political situation worldwide.
Even locally in Norway, it is difficult without political backing and public acceptance.

My point is that nature, climate, and population need to be viewed more holistically.

The climate crisis cannot be solved without addressing the nature crisis and the problem of global population growth.
There has been far too much of a tendency, even in Norway, to treat climate issues in isolation.
The so-called green transition relies too heavily on heavy industrial solutions and technological optimism, as if they alone can solve the problem.

But don’t give up. I don’t have all the answers. Remember that your effort and reflection also matter.
