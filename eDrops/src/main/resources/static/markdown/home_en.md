## Welcome to Reiers home page

Nearly completed..

With boring design, but engagin content. I hope.

( If not happening automagically.
Use the dropdown button on the top right to switch between Norwegian and English.
Some articles are only written in one language )

When you click on something her, 
you are probably without knowing it on a round trip to the Netherlands.
Now, I don't live there but at Moelv, Innlandet, Norway.
Don't be afraid, you will not be infected by some virus.  

Technology can be simple and difficult at the same time.
This web page is no rocket science.

We humans are just producing stuff that can be used for something useful.
The problem is that we create caos that we cannot get rid of at the same time.
The nature is caos developed by itself gradually in centuries.
The technology aims at taking shortcuts and produces caos more rapidly.
This is way technology usually is not adapted to nature.
This is way it becomes a problem.
Even this web page, although not the worst.

To get rid of the unwanted byproduct new tech is the only solution?
The green shift has arisen because we cannot put the byproducts
into the circuit of nature, or it becomes waste.
And because someone think they will earn money and solve the crisis at the 
same time. It is impossible. We are stuck here with a never ending story.

It is maybe some somewhat better methods to fix bad technology.

My car releases the spirit from the bottle, that is the main problem.  
I cannot live without a car, or can I? My cat can...
but he is now and when transported to the vet in a cage in my car. 
I can switch to a car fuelling on electrical power
but then huge batteries consume electrical energy and other resources.
Globally this is solved with coal power plants that emits C02.  

I Norway we are lucky with enough rainfall and water power.
But still we want to consume even more.
The so-called green solution is windmills they claim.
Only effective when the wind blows but not to much.

Alternatively  
Better technology exists  
That does not transfer untouched nature to industrial sites.  
Or even better  
Consume less  
Recycle more  
Back to nature  
So simple and so difficult.  
A black hole swallows unlimited amounts of energy  
But we cannot exploit it.  
Nuclear power perhaps better.  

If you have managed to reach this far at the bottom of the page
you can visit other parts of this website about tech and why we use it.
