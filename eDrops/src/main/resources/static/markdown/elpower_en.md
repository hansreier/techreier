## About my electic power manifest for Norway

This manifest was written simply because I am frustrated regarding the current energy policy in Norway.
What is alarming is that the current political direction does not solve the climate crisis, aggrevates the nature crisis,
creates unnecessary inflation, higher interest rates, poverty, and contempt for politicians. 
A century of efforts by the entire Norwegian society
to build an industrial nation based on cheap hydropower has been reversed and destroyed in just a few years.
Norway had a system with stable, cheap electric power that worked well for many years.
We no longer have that, but an EU-adapted market-based power system with extremely high and fluctuating electricity prices.
Now and for the foreseeable future! Note also that this policy creates a lot of problems internally in EU.
Norway imports the high unstable spot power prices from Germany (and UK), although the entire physical power chain is
domestic. Additionally, there is potential for power shortages: 
Primarily due to new high-capacity cables to Scotland and Germany,
but also due to misunderstood so-called green energy-wasting projects to try to solve the climate crisis.   

It started with the Norwegian Energy Law in 1991 and has gradually worsened, 
especially in recent years with the adoption of EU energy market packages.  

This manifest outlines the main direction Norway should take to resolve the electricity (price) crisis 
while also contributing to solve the climate crisis and preventing massive loss of nature. 
This differs significantly from both the current energy policy of the Socialist government, 
as well as the previous energy policy of the Conservative government.  

The measures are not described in detail. I do not state wheather Norway should drop the existing EEA agreement,
including ACER, and renegotiate existing power agreements with foreign countries.
However, it is quite obvious to me that if the necessary adjustments cannot be made within this framework,
both the EEA agreement and ACER should be terminated and replaced with trade agreements. 
The willingness to make the necessary adjustments or start negotiations on this with the EU, etc.,
has been virtually nonexistent for the current government.  

SOURCES OF INSPIRATION

- The Norwegian Facebook group. We that demained cheaper electricity bills had more than 600000 members.
- Look at "Motvind Norge" fighting agains Wind Turbines in Norwegian nature and Norways official energy policy.
- Look at The Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and fight agains Wind Turbines and general misuse of Nature.
- Look at how the energy grid in Germany is destabilices by extensive use of windturbines and solar power.
- Look to the dysfunctional Eu Norpool power market that dictates spot prices in the south of Norway.
- Look at what professional energy experts tells us about the Norwegian Grid (Several links from this web site)  

It is quite obvious that the leading political parties in Norway are completely out of sync with the public
when it comes to energy policy related to the production, distribution, sale, and consumption of electric power.
There is skepticism towards public bureaucracy, power companies, and the entire renewable energy sector.
A good indicator is the performance of so-called green funds that invest in renewable energy. Avoid them!
I demand that politicians at least understand the difference between dispatchable and non-dispatchable electric power
and the negative consequences large amounts of new non-dispatchable power will have on the Norwegian power grid.  

Leading Norwegian politic parties should take notice of the public opinion of this subject that exists in Norway and
change there policies. To be noted: 
It is not professionally or scientifically proven that the current policies actually is  working.
The opposite is closer to the truth.  

"You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time."  
Abraham Lincoln.  

A lot depends on the measures one should take to solve the climate crisis.
Pouring massive amounts of incorrect measures such as wind farms and electrification of platforms 
makes people lose faith in the green transition. And then it definitely won't work. Never. 
The climate crisis and nature crisis are only solved if each of us makes an effort. 
And this effort is limited in itself if met with hopeless expensive measures, economic problems, 
high inflation and interest rates, misdirected taxation, as well as government and political arrogance in general.  

This applies worldwide and NOT just in Norway. The problem is international. 
Simply solving it in Norway helps very little and can even have a negative effect. 
If industry is driven out of Norway and Europe due to poor conditions and high energy prices, 
others like China will take over this business. In addition to not being as renewable-minded as Norway,
there will be much additional transportation which also emits CO2. 
Then we're back to square one. 
Europe's strict policies to support the Paris Agreement increases global CO2 emissions instead of reducing them.  

And finally: In Norway (and Germany), we have an aversion to nuclear power. 
This is likely the only energy source in the world that can overall reduce CO2 emissions and simultaneously
meet the world's energy needs and solve the climate crisis. Understand it if you can.
