### How to make a text based web site without coding HTML

The goal is to make this as simple as possible where the user does it in an input
window.  An option is to use markdown like this readme.md file, since
it is simpler than RTF and uses less space. Perhaps the system will support both
formats. Ediotors (both outside of this project, or include in the code can be used).

The first attempt is to use markdown written in Intellij or other editor, store it as a file  
together with project code and pick it up as a part of the Web GUI. No database is really needed.
I still use a relational database for structuring the blogs and metadata, and to enable to 
write and view the blogs in various languages.
